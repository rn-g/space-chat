# SPACECHAT

_What if you could magically understand anyone in the world?  
What if you could experience a conversation beyond words?_

Spacechat is a virtual reality chatroom that allows users to interpret and experience speech with multiple senses. Users enter a mesmerizing digital world where they can speak with others in twelve languages using automatic realtime translation, and watch the emotional content of their conversation rendered dazzlingly in virtual reality.

## Future directions
- [ ] open source release, to allow users to create and submit their own VR worlds
